                                Hello! My name is Michael and I'm a student at the Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp in 
                                Atlanta, GA. I graduated from Georgia Southern University in 2017 with a Bachelor of Science in 
                                Geology and a minor in Geospatial Information Systems (GIS). After realizing that I didn't want 
                                to be a geologist, I decided that I wanted to pursue a more technical career. I currently work as
                                a GIS Analyst for Southern Company Gas also in Atlanta, GA. My goal is to get a more technical GIS 
                                Analyst position that involves coding which is why I decided to enroll in this course. However, even
                                if I decide that a GIS Analyst position is not for me anymore, taking this course and learning how to
                                code will make me a more well-rounded individual when it comes to advancing my career.
                            </p>

                            Some interesting things to know about me are that I'm a long distance runner. I ran track and cross country
                            in high school and I've ran several road races including the annual Peachtree Road Race, several 5k races,
                            and four half-marathons. I love to travel, I've been to Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Czech Republic and   
                            the Netherlands. Other random things about me include obsessing over Game of Thrones, eating as much dark 
                            chocolate with almonds and sea salt as possible, if I were an animal I'd be a gazelle since my friends say 
                            I run like a gazelle and my favorite city in the world as of now is Prague!
